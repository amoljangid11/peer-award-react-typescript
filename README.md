## Tech stack

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for a fast and clean start and written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

It uses [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) as UI framework as it helps to start immediately building modern-looking GUI without significant efforts or customization.

[Formik](https://formik.org/) and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) are used for fast and well-tested form validation. [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) is used for dates formatting.

Tests are ran using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Pre-commit linting is set with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).
